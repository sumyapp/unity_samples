# Unity2D Components

This repository holds a varied collection of Unity3D components that I've built for use in the 2D Platformer/RPG I'm currently developing. The entire codebase is a work in progress, but please feel free to take a look around.

The components here are by no means an entire game—they're more like puzzle pieces that I'm constantly enhancing, reworking, and adding to. More documentation will come, *as time permits.*

## Installation

**Hey hey—no installation required!** This repo is probably most useful as a collection of C# scripts you can peruse for examples and usage ideas.

## Credit
Within the components included here you'll find reference to a number of great software packages, including the most excellent [CharacterController2D](https://github.com/prime31/CharacterController2D), the incredibly useful [Advanced C# Messenger](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Advanced_CSharp_Messenger), and perhaps my favorite Unity add-on of all, [DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/). All of these packages have been instrumental in the development of my current project.
